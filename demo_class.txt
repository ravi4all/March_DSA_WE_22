Data Structures
- data organization
- management
- storage

Why Data Structure ?
- Finding Shortest Path
- Linked List - Music Playlist
- Stack - Undo Operations, Browser Back Functionality
- Graphs - Relationship on social media
- Tree - Folders in OS
- Queue - Key press sequence in keyboard

Graph DB
- Neo4J

What is Algo ?
- Set of sequential steps for solving a problem

Algo - Time and Space
Math + Programming (Java)

Analysis of Algorithm
- before implementing any problem first analyze the problem

Measure of Performance
- Space
- Time
- Network

Example
- Let's do sum of n natural number
  i/p : n = 5
  o/p : 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

Approach 1
 : sum = 0
 : for i = 0 to i <= n
       sum = sum + i;

 - time taken is C2n + C3

Approach 2
 : sum = 0;
 : for i = 0 to i <= n
       for j = 1 to j <= i
           sum++;

 - time taken is C4n ^ 2 + C3n + C6

Approach 3
 : n * (n + 1) / 2

 - time taken in C1, because when we perform arithmetic operations, it takes
   time that is irrespective to input 


Find the Missing Number
- i/p : [1,2,3,6,7,8,4]
- o/p : 5


Aysmptotic Analysis
- measure order of growth of time taken by a function in terms on input n

- Big O
- Theta
- Omega
