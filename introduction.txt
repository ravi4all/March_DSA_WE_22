Data Structure Introduction

- management, storage, organization of data

Time
Space

Why we learn Data Structure ?
- Google Map - Shortest Path
- Music Player - song next or prev - doubly linked list
- browser navigation - Linked List / Stack
- Graph - Social media connections
- Tree - Folders in OS
- Queue - used by OS for Job Scheduling


Data Structure lend itself to efficient algorithm
Data Structure and algorithm go hand in hand


Algorithm
- step by step procedure to solve a problem
- sequential steps for solving a problem


Performance of algorithm

Measure of performance
- Time
- Space
- Network


Asymptotic Analysis
- Analysis of Algorithm

- it measures order of growth
  - if n(input) grows so how much time grows it linearly, exponentially, constant or quadratically
- does not depend upon machine or programming language
- no need to implement algorithm practially on machine, we just analyse and determine the algo is efficient or not...
